# The EcksDee Programming Language
	Created by Jesse A. Jones (KesseNones)
	Inspired by Forth

## Introduction:
		The EcksDee programming language started as an interpretor 
	for a really simple Forth dialect in Programming Language Design. 
	From there, I decided to make my own programming language 
	once I learned the basics. From there I added variables, 
	and changed function syntax lightly, 
	making it officially its own programming language. 
	Ever since more features have been added 
	to make it even more its own language. The main features 
	of the language are detailed below.

## Mechanics:
### Data Types:
		This language contains multiple data types that are pushed onto the stack. 
	The data types currently are:
		
		-Integer: An integer value that depends on system architecture for size. On most modern machines it'll range from -2^63 to 2^63 - 1 as a signed 64 bit integer. Pushing values onto the stack that are of type Integer is easy: just push a whole number, i.e. 42, 666, 2319, etc.  

		-BigInteger: This is like the previous data type except it has no upper or lower bound limits. It can keep growing in either direction for as much space as is able to be allocated to it. Pushing values onto the stack of type BigInteger is very similar to type Integer as one would expect except that XXX
		
		-Float: This is a type capable of expressing floating point values with 32 bits of precission. 
		
		-Double: X
		
		-Char: X
		
		-String: X
		
		-Boolean: X
		
		-List: X
### Operators:
		X
### Functions:
		X
### Variables:
		X

## Conclusion:
		X
