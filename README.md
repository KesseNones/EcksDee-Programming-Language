# The EcksDee Programming Language
	Created by Jesse A. Jones (KesseNones)
	Inspired by Forth

## Introduction:
		The EcksDee programming language started as an interpretor 
	for a really simple Forth dialect in Programming Language Design. 
	From there, I decided to make my own programming language 
	once I learned the basics. From there I added variables, 
	and changed function syntax lightly, 
	making it officially its own programming language. 
	Ever since more features have been added 
	to make it even more its own language. The main features 
	of the language are detailed below.

## Mechanics:
